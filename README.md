- Medium: 30-45 minutes
- Hard: 45-60+ minutes

**4. Learn from Solutions**
- If stuck for >30 mins, look at hints
- Study optimal solutions
- Implement from memory later

**5. Focus on Patterns**
- Don't memorize solutions
- Understand the underlying pattern
- Apply pattern to similar problems

### 📊 Difficulty Distribution
